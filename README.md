# PublicissapientTask

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

## Approach For Developement:
    with clear glance of requirement I understood that it has to work with user instruction and more of route path.
    Used an service that will interact with SpaceX Api and it will allow us to get data based on PARAMS passed.
    injected that service into Component and subscribe the service and bound that data with view.
## Requirements handled
    As mentioned that the app should load server response used getMethod() which will get year information and binded that to view with a button
    The data will be filtered based on user interaction($event) and append that PARAMS and provide route path accordingly.
    Created Mobile first UI and written responsive queries, that will match all the view ports. 
    
 ## App functionality. 
    On lauch it will show the years and for the first time it will take some time to load the data.
